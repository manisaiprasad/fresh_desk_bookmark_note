## Inspiration

Many times agents have to handle multiple tickets, and based on the response from the customer, agents need to remember and revisit tickets important to them.

## What it does

This app allows agents to bookmark couple tickets with personal note and revisit them whenever they want to.

## How we built it

I built it using javascript for freshdesk with fdk. When an agent add's a bookmark, the note and ticket will be stored inside a database, and we will fetch the bookmarks across the app.  We used a server.js file for database operations with our app code in app.js to handel the operations

## Challenges we ran into

Its been tricky to find a way to store data with freshdesk app, but docs are a lot helpfull

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

Finally building something that can be used for increasing productivity of agents is great to hear

## What we learned

Learned about a lot of things, It's been an interesting and fun ride with freshdesk api's and fdk.

## What's next for Bookmark tickets with personal notes

We can add attachments to the bookmarks to save more information about the tickets, so that agents can get a quick glance about the ticket
